    	<h1>Floyd, Justin</h1>
    	<p> Three Facts About Me: I lived most of my life in Virginia and went to William and Mary for the first two years of college before transferring. I broke my ankle ice skating in the middle of my basketball season junior year of high school.  I'm a senior and am looking forward to graduating at the end of the semester. I'm studying computer science because I've always been interested in modern tech.  I'm looking for jobs with technical applications that aren't exclusivley coding like software testing and technical business analysts for after graduation.</p>
